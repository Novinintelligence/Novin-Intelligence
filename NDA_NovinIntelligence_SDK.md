**Effective Date**: September 25, 2025  

## Parties  
This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between:  
- **Novin Intelligence Ltd**, a United Kingdom corporation with its principal place of business at 123 Security Lane, London, EC1A 1AA, United Kingdom ("Disclosing Party" or "Provider"), and  
- **_________________________________**, a _________________________________ with its principal place of business at _________________________________ ("Receiving Party" or "Licensee").  

Provider and Licensee are each a "Party" and collectively the "Parties."  

## 1. Purpose  
The Parties wish to explore a potential business relationship involving evaluation, integration, testing, and support of the proprietary "NovinIntelligence" software development kit and related technology ("SDK"). In the course of those discussions, each Party may disclose to the other certain confidential and proprietary information. This Agreement sets the terms under which such information will be protected.  

## 2. Definition of Confidential Information  
"Confidential Information" means any non-public information, whether oral, written, electronic, graphic, or in any other form, that a Party discloses to the other and that (a) is marked or identified as confidential, or (b) by its nature or the circumstances of disclosure, a reasonable person would understand to be confidential. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, source code, object code, AI models, Python runtime files, business plans, product roadmaps, customer lists, pricing, and the existence and terms of this Agreement.  

## 3. Exclusions  
Confidential Information does not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate:  
- (i) is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement;  
- (ii) was lawfully known to the Receiving Party before disclosure;  
- (iii) is rightfully received from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or  
- (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information.  

## 4. Obligations of the Receiving Party  
The Receiving Party will:  
- (a) use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose;  
- (b) restrict disclosure of the Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, and professional advisers who need to know and who are bound by written obligations at least as protective as this Agreement;  
- (c) exercise at least the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care; and  
- (d) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use or disclosure and cooperate in any remediation efforts.  

## 5. Term and Survival  
This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and remains in effect for three (3) years unless earlier terminated in writing by either Party. The confidentiality obligations for information disclosed during the term will survive for five (5) years after termination, except that source code, AI models, and security architecture documents will be protected perpetually.  

## 6. Mandatory Disclosure  
If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, it will (where legally permitted) give the Disclosing Party prompt written notice and reasonable assistance so the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.  

## 7. Return or Destruction  
Upon the Disclosing Party's written request or termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will promptly return or destroy all tangible embodiments of the Confidential Information, including all copies and notes, and certify in writing its compliance, except that one archival copy may be retained solely for legal or regulatory purposes.  

## 8. No License  
Except for the limited rights expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement grants the Receiving Party any license or other intellectual-property right in or to the Confidential Information.  

## 9. Remedies  
The Parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be inadequate. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available, the Disclosing Party is entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any such breach or threatened breach without the necessity of posting bond.  

## 10. Governing Law and Venue  
This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales (excluding its conflict-of-laws principles). Any dispute arising under this Agreement will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in London, United Kingdom, and each Party consents to such jurisdiction and venue.  

## 11. Miscellaneous  
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether written or oral. Any amendment must be in writing and signed by both Parties. Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, except to a successor in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets. If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Failure to enforce any provision will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement.
